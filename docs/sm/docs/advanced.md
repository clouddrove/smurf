Smurf is a command-line interface (CLI) application built using Golang leveraging technology specific SDKs, designed to simplify and automate commands for essential tools like Terraform and Docker. It provides intuitive, unified commands to execute Terraform plans, Docker container management, and other DevOps tasks seamlessly from one interface. Whether you need to spin up environments, manage containers, or apply infrastructure as code, this CLI streamlines multi-tool operations, boosting productivity and reducing context-switching.

Smurf isn‚Äôt just another CLI tool‚Äîit‚Äôs your DevOps powerhouse. Managing Terraform, Docker, and other essential tools separately is a hassle. Constant context-switching slows you down, and remembering multiple CLI syntaxes is frustrating. Smurf simplifies this by providing a unified, intuitive interface to streamline your workflows.
With Smurf, you can spin up environments, manage containers, and apply infrastructure as code‚Äîall from a single command-line tool. It boosts productivity, reduces errors, and helps you focus on delivering solutions rather than troubleshooting commands. If efficiency and automation matter to you, Smurf is the tool you‚Äôve been waiting for.
