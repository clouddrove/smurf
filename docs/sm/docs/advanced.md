## Troubleshooting

- **"go: command not found"** → Ensure Go is installed and accessible via `PATH`.
- **"permission denied"** → Run the installation script with `sudo bash install_smurf.sh`.
- **"cannot move smurf: No such file or directory"** → Ensure `go build` is successful and the binary exists in the `build` directory.
