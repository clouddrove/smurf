Smurf is a command-line interface (CLI) application built using Golang leveraging technology specific SDKs, designed to simplify and automate commands for essential tools like Terraform and Docker. It provides intuitive, unified commands to execute Terraform plans, Docker container management, and other DevOps tasks seamlessly from one interface. Whether you need to spin up environments, manage containers, or apply infrastructure as code, this CLI streamlines multi-tool operations, boosting productivity and reducing context-switching.
</p>

## Installation ⚙️
- [Smurf tool CLI Installation Guide](docs/sm/docs/installation.md)
- Quick binary install (downloads the release archive for your OS/arch and verifies it against `checksums.txt`):
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clouddrove/smurf/master/install/install.sh | bash
  ```
- Integrate in GitHub Actions
  ```yaml
    - name: Setup Smurf
      uses: clouddrove/smurf@v1.1.5
  ```

## Quickstart 🏁

```bash
# Scaffold a smurf.yaml with both sdkr and selm sections (0600, refuses to overwrite)
smurf init

# Build the Docker image described in smurf.yaml
smurf sdkr build

# Build, push, and (if selm.deployHelm is true) install/upgrade the Helm release, all from smurf.yaml
smurf deploy
```

## Features 🚀

### 🐳 Docker Command Wrapper (`sdkr`)
Streamline Docker image workflows:
- `build`, `scan`, `tag`, `push`, `remove`, `init`
- `provision-acr`/`provision-ecr`/`provision-gcp`/`provision-ghcr`/`provision-hub` → each runs (`build` ➝ `push`), prompting `Proceed with push? [y/N]` on a TTY unless `--yes` is passed
- [Docker with Smurf – Usage Guide](docs/sdkr/README.md)

---

### ⚓ Helm Command Wrapper (`selm`)
Simplify Helm operations:
- `create`, `install`, `lint`, `list`, `status`, `template`, `upgrade`, `uninstall`, `init`, `debug`, `plugin`
- `provision` → runs (`install` ➝ `upgrade` ➝ `lint` ➝ `template`)
- [Helm with Smurf – Usage Guide](docs/selm/README.md)

---

### 🏗️ Terraform Command Wrapper (`stf`)
Easily manage Terraform workflows:
- `init`, `plan`, `apply`, `output`, `drift`, `validate`, `destroy`, `fmt`, `show`, `import`, `refresh`, `graph`, `state-list`, `state-rm`, `state-push`, `state-pull`
- `provision` → runs (`init` ➝ `plan` ➝ `apply` ➝ `output`); applying requires `--auto-approve` (default `false`)
- [Terraform with Smurf – Usage Guide](docs/stf/README.md)

---

### 🚀 `smurf deploy` command
Reads `smurf.yaml`, builds the Docker image, pushes it to whichever registry is enabled, and (if `selm.deployHelm` is true) installs or upgrades the Helm release.
- `deploy` → runs (`build` ➝ `push` ➝ Helm install/upgrade), controlled by `--timeout` (seconds, default `600`)

---

## 🧰 Credential Fallback from `smurf.yaml`

Smurf supports **automatic credential fallback**.  
If required credentials (like username or token) are not provided via CLI or environment variables, Smurf will read them directly from your `smurf.yaml` file. Values also support `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation.

See the [full `smurf.yaml` field reference](docs/sm/docs/configuration.md) for every supported key.

### Example
```yaml
sdkr:
  awsECR: false
  dockerHub: false
  ghcrRepo: false
  dockerfile: ""
  imageName: ""
selm:
  chartName: ""
  deployHelm: true
  fileName: ""
  namespace: ""
  releaseName: ""
  revision: 0
  ```

---

### ☁️ Multicloud Container Registry
Push images to multiple registries from one CLI:
- Supported: **AWS ECR**, **GCP GCR**, **Azure ACR**, **Docker Hub**
- Example:
  ```bash
  smurf sdkr push --help
  ```
